Constraints
===========
    For scientific and analyze uses, this application is orientated to various 
    users(biologists) all over the world. Before developing the project, we have 
    to take some main constraints into account so that we can come up any useful ideas
    to deal with them in the future. 

Browser Compatibility
---------------------
    Since the application is designed for a wildly used application, 
    it should have a cross platform compatibility to satisfy various users.
    Thus the application should be accessible through Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. 


Space Complexity
----------------
    We should consider not only the time complexity, but also the 
    space complexity, which has two aspects. One is the size of the 
    entire Web application. Applications should not exceed 500MB. 
    On the other hand, when an application starts data analysis, 
    it must limit its memory footprint to a certain level to ensure 
    that the system works in an appropriate way. 


Budget
------
    Budget less than 10,000 USD(To Be Specified). 

System Downtime
---------------
    System downtime less than 30 minutes per year in order to satisfy users'
    large demand of data analyzing.
